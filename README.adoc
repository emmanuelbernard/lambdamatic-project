= Backyard Roadmap

== Lambda Expression parsing

Need to implement support for:

* Other forms of expression (ie: >, <, >=, etc.)
* Expression with external parameter
* Expression with external parameter on which a method is called

== Query API

* Build metaclasses with Annotation Processing Tool ?
* Define Query API:
** Support search/load queries
** Support insert/upsert/delete queries
** Support Aggregator Framework
* BSON <-> Annotated Java classes
* Provide a @DocumentManager with:
** save(Object)
** load(ObjectId/Long)
** query()
** ...

== Usage in CDI application

* Inject a @Collection as CDI Bean ?
* Type-safe API -> @Collection as a meta-annotation:

[code, java]
----
@Retention(value=RetentionPolicy.RUNTIME)
@Target(value=ElementType.?)
@Collection("Photo")
public @interface PhotoCollection {
----

-> does this means that a @Producer should be generated from the APT, too ?
-> "Collection" interface and APT generated implementation ?

== Integration

* Wildfly ?
* Vert.x ?
* Netty ?
* Undertow ?


== Reactive Programming

* Non blocking I/O
* MongoDB capped collections
